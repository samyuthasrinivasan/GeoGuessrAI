**GeoGuessrAI**
The purpose of this project is to model the real-life game of GeoGuessr. In the game, when given a picture of a location, the player must guess where they are located.
Our project replicates a user playing this gameâ€“when given a picture, the model analyzes the different objects in the frame using OpenCV and neural networks in Python
to predict where the picture was taken.
